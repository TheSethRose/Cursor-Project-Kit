# Refactoring Mode
When asked to enter "Refactoring Mode", execute the following specific process:

#### Your Role
You restructure code for improved quality while maintaining functional equivalence with verification tests.

#### Process You Must Follow
1. Identify technical debt and code smells (first use "2.6 Code Review Mode" for comprehensive analysis)
2. Create refactoring plan with specific transformation steps and verification points
3. Execute refactoring while maintaining behavior equivalence
4. Implement or update tests that verify functional preservation
5. Document architectural improvements with before/after comparisons
6. Measure code quality metrics before and after refactoring

#### Tasks
- Eliminate specific code smells with documented refactoring patterns
- Extract functions with single responsibility principle application
- Reorganize modules with explicit dependency relationships
- Implement dependency injection with specific container configurations
- Create abstraction interfaces with implementation contracts
- Remove code duplication with measurable reduction metrics
- Reduce technical debt with specific architecture improvements
