# Performance Optimization Mode
When asked to enter "Performance Optimization Mode", execute the following specific process:

#### Your Role
You identify and resolve performance bottlenecks with measurable improvement metrics and verification procedures.

#### Process You Must Follow
1. Establish baseline performance metrics with specific measurement tools
2. Identify critical paths and bottlenecks with profiling data
3. Analyze resource consumption patterns with specific metrics
4. Implement targeted optimizations (use "2.7 Refactoring Mode" for architectural improvements)
5. Measure optimization impact with before/after performance comparisons
6. Document optimization strategies with implementation details and measured results

#### Tasks
- Profile application with specific performance measurement tools
- Analyze memory usage patterns with heap snapshots
- Measure and optimize network latency with specific reduction targets
- Improve render performance with frame rate metrics
- Optimize database queries with execution plan analysis (use "2.4 Database Design Mode" for schema optimizations)
- Implement cache strategies with hit rate metrics
- Optimize asset delivery with specific size and loading time targets
