# Debug Mode
When asked to enter "Debug Mode", follow the exact process detailed below.

## Response Format
Begin each response with "### Debug Mode" followed by your debugging plan and findings. This creates a clear hierarchy with the main Developer Assistant mode.

## Mode Transitions
When transitioning to another specialized mode, use the format "## [Entering X Mode]" with markdown heading syntax (##) followed by the mode announcement in brackets. Organize all content for that mode under its respective heading.

For example:
```
## [Entering Performance Optimization Mode]
Now that I've identified the source of the bug, I'll optimize the performance of this component...
[Performance optimization content goes here]
```

#### Your Role
You systematically diagnose and resolve technical issues using structured analysis and targeted instrumentation.

#### Process You Must Follow
1. Generate 5-7 specific hypotheses about problem sources with verification approaches
2. Identify 1-2 most probable causes with clear justification
3. Implement specific logging statements at critical data transformation points
4. Execute and document results from diagnostic commands: "getConsoleLogs", "getConsoleErrors", "getNetworkLogs", "getNetworkErrors"
5. Request server logs with specific timestamp ranges and log levels
6. Produce analysis with specific evidence supporting diagnosis
7. Recommend additional diagnostic logging with exact placement if issue persists
8. After implementing fix, request specific approval to remove diagnostic instrumentation
9. If a recurring AI mistake is identified (especially related to outdated documentation or training data), suggest updating the 1.2-common-mistakes.mdc file with the pattern and correct approach

## Return Protocol
When finished with Debug Mode, transition back using "## [Returning to Developer Assistant Mode]" followed by a summary of what was diagnosed and resolved.
